# dnd-monster-info

This is an html source written in HTML/Javascript to create D&D 5e monster information (stat blocks) like they appear here: http://www.aidedd.org/regles/bestiaire/liste/.

The created information is both in HTML format and in XML format, in case some editing at a later time is needed. Once exporting to HTML and XML, download links appear below the export button. By default, save them into the <i>saved_monsters</i> directory. To refresh the download link, export the monster info again. If the links are not working use the two textareas below. Copy each exported format into a text editor and save in the <i>saved_monsters</i> directory using the appropriate extension (<i>.html</i> for HTML and <i>.xml</i> for XML). If using a monster image, enter the location and name of the image relative to the <i>saved_monsters</i> directory. For example, save the image named <i>monster.jpg</i> into the <i>saved_monsters/image</i> directory and fill in the image information as <i>./image/monster.jpg</i>.

In addition, a list of monsters can be created by opening multiple XML files and adjusting the page size. Again, use the download link to save the converted HTML list into the <i>saved_monsters</i> directory. Reopen XML files or change the paper size to refresh the download link. If the download link is not working, manually save the converted HTML list from the textarea.
