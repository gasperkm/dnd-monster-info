# dnd-monster-info

This is a html source written in HTML/Javascript to create D&D 5e monster information (stat blocks) like they appear here: http://www.aidedd.org/regles/bestiaire/liste/
The created information is both in HTML format and in XML format, if some editing at a later time is needed.

In addition, there are scripts (get_monster_list.bat for Windows and get_monster_list.sh for Linux) to create a list of all monsters saved in the saved_monsters directory. To use, run either of the two scripts and then open all_monsters.html in a web browser (preferably firefox).
